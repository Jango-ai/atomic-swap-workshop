# Atomic Swap Workshop

This repository contains a simple Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating a basic Hash Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) in Solidity.

## 🔄 What is an Atomic Swap?

An atomic swap allows the exchange of cryptocurrencies across different blockchains without the need for a trusted third party. It uses a smart contract that ensures both parties fulfill their obligations or the transaction is voided.

This PoC simulates an HTLC-based atomic swap using Ethereum-compatible smart contracts.

## 📁 Structure

- `contracts/AtomicSwap.sol`: Core HTLC contract in Solidity
- `scripts/deploy.js`: Script to deploy the contract
- `README.md`: This documentation

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Compile the contract:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

3. Deploy the contract:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Node.js
- Hardhat (`npm install --save-dev hardhat`)
- A local Ethereum node (e.g., Hardhat Network or Ganache)
